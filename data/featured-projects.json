I also created a scheduling tool to add particular emails, such as feeds and blasts to be queued on reoccurring schedules.

An event tool needed to be developed to make law student life as easy as possible. Instead of having users come to \"another\" site to check on their event schedules I developed a tool to sync all of the events they are attending to their Google Calendars as well."
